Portable charging stations Aferiy and Fossibot are made by the Chinese company SYD and use the RS485 standard for communication between components.
Using ESP32 and ESPHome, you can receive additional data from the station about the voltage on the battery cells, the total voltage on the battery, and the difference in voltage on the cells.

Tested on Aferiy P280 (Should also work on P210, P180 and others.)
